Problem: 1 | Control structure (If else)



Suppose that x, y, and z are int variables, and a = 100, b = 105, and c = 30. Write a single C++ code to
determine whether the following expressions evaluate to true or false.

    1.   (a > b) || (c < d) && (a== c*3)
    2.   (a > b) && ((a < c) || (c == 10))
    3.   (a <= b - 2) && (b >= c) || (c - 2! = 20)
    4.   a<= 5 || b < 15
    5.   ((day == "Saturday") || (day == "Sunday")) && (weather == "Sunny") {take input from User}



Problem: 2 | Control structure (If else)



Write a program to calculate the electricity bill of FAST-NU Faisalabad. The rates of electricity per unit
are as follow:

    1. If the units consumed are equal or less than 100, then the cost is Rs. 9.5/- Per unit and no
       surcharge of bills is added.
    2. If units consumed are within 101-300, then the cost is Rs. 10.5/- per unit and a surcharge of 30%
       of bill is added.
    3. If units consumed more than 300, then the cost is Rs. 15/- per unit and a surcharge of 40 % is
       added.

Keep in mind that you should take values from user in the current and previous reading forms.

For example, I have reading of month January 3466 units and counting for February. I will enter previous
reading 3466 and the current reading will be 3600 for February. So, I get (3600-3466= 144units).
Note:

    •    The answer should be as precise as you can.
    •    Means that use int where int use and use float/double where use.
Problem: 3 | Repetitive structure

Write a program that uses a while statement to find the smallest integer from multiple integers. First
input number which define the number of integer values you want to enter then input all values and
finally find

    1. Largest integer
    2. Smallest Integer
    3. mid integer



Problem: 4 |pointers



Write a program which declares an array of 5 numbers. Initialize the array with 3, 9, 1, 15, 3. Now
use the

    •   Increment operator
    •   Decrement operator

in pointers to print the address and values of each index. Also compare all values of pointers

and display if some values are equal.
Problem: 5|Functions



The Fibonacci series

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,…

(a) Write a nonrecursive function fibonacci(n) that uses type int to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

(b) Determine the largest int Fibonacci number that can be printed on your system. Modify the program
of part (a)to use double instead of int to calculate and return Fibonacci numbers and use this modified
program to repeat part(b).



Problem: 6|Functions



Write a function that takes an integer value and returns the number with its digits reversed. For
example, given the number1234, thefunctionshouldreturn4321



Problem: 7|Functions



Write a c++ program that creates a file and stores following operation in the file
    1. Add
    2. Subtract
    3. Multiply
    4. Divide
    5. Square root
    6. Modulus
Ask user to input two number. Now read above operations from file and display on console.
Now get choice from user which operation user want to perform. After operation is applied store the
result in same file by using append operation.

Problem:8 |Pointers



Write a c++ program, you have an array of double and a double type of pointer
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.01, 3.4, 17.0, 50.40};

   double *p;

   p = balance;

Now you have to print the array using p pointer.


Problem: 9|pointers

Write a C++ program where you have two integer variables
         int firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;

and two pointers

         int * p1, * p2;

You have    to perform the following steps
   • //     p1 = address of firstvalue
   • //     p2 = address of secondvalue
   • //     value pointed by p1 = 10
   • //     value pointed by p2 = value pointed by p1
   • //     p1 = p2 (address of pointer is copied)
   •  //    value pointed by p1 = 20
   •  //    print firstvalue, secondvalue

And comment like above after each step
Values will be p1=10 and p2=20




Problem: 10|Pointer



Take two numbers from user as input in pointer and perform following operations on
variables using pointers.

1. Addition
2.   Subtraction
3.   Multiplication
4.   Division.
5.   Mod
